# Changelog

All notable changes to ARIA will be documented in this file.

## [2.4.0] - 2026-04-06

### Added
- `/index` skill — scans promoted knowledge files, normalizes tags, detects staleness, suggests cross-references between files with 2+ shared tags, updates project-to-tag mappings, and regenerates `index.md`
- `/context` skill — on-demand knowledge retrieval by topic tags with OR (default) and AND modes, project tag expansion (e.g., `/context ss` expands to all Seersite-relevant tags), summary-first presentation with selective file loading
- Tag convention — YAML frontmatter `tags: [tag1, tag2]` on all promoted knowledge files, with seeded known tags across tech domain, cross-cutting, tool/service, process, and project groups
- `index.md` generated artifact at knowledge folder root — tag-first index with Known Tags, Tag Index, Other Tags, Stale Files, and Untagged Files sections
- Staleness detection — flags promoted files not updated within configurable threshold (default: 6 months)
- Bidirectional cross-reference linking — `/index` suggests `## Related` links between files sharing 2+ tags, detects reverse link gaps
- Session-start knowledge surfacing — hook prompts Claude to suggest `/context` command after user states their task (when index exists)
- Planning path abbreviated Rule 22 — `pre-edit-check.sh` and `post-edit-check.sh` hook scripts detect `docs/specs/` and `docs/plans/` paths and allow one-line assessment instead of full framework, with protected filename safeguard for operational files (CLAUDE.md, working-rules.md, etc.)
- `freeform_promotion_threshold` config key (default: 3) — suggest promoting freeform tags to known after this many files
- `staleness_threshold_months` config key (default: 6) — flag knowledge files older than this

### Changed
- `/audit-knowledge` — new Step 5c cross-references backlog entries against promoted docs (topic overlap and potential invalidation detection), new Step 6 sections for Stale Knowledge and Cross-Reference Findings, new Step 7b rebuilds index after promotions
- `/setup` — offers advanced options for freeform promotion threshold and staleness threshold
- `plugin.json` hooks — PreToolUse and PostToolUse now use bash scripts (`pre-edit-check.sh`, `post-edit-check.sh`) instead of inline echo commands, enabling planning path detection
- `config.sh` — parses `freeform_promotion_threshold` and `staleness_threshold_months` with defaults and numeric validation
- `LOCAL.md` template — format templates now include `tags:` in frontmatter, new Tag Convention section, `/context` and `/index` added to When to Read table
- `README.md` template — `index.md` in structure diagram, tagging and index conventions added

## [2.3.2] - 2026-04-06

### Added
- `intake/clippings/`, `intake/notes/`, `intake/attachments/` subdirectories in template — new users now get the full content capture structure on `/setup`
- "Extended Structure" example section in `LOCAL.md` template — shows users how to document custom subdirectory organization
- Comprehensive feature list in README
- Obsidian Web Clipper recommendation in README and OVERVIEW template
- Support section with PayPal and Venmo in README

### Changed

### Changed
