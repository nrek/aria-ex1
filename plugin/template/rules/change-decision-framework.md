# Change Decision Framework

A process discipline system for Claude Code that enforces structured decision-making before code changes and scope verification after. Implemented via hooks in `.claude/settings.local.json`.

---

## Why This Exists

When making code changes, it's easy to skip directly to execution without evaluating alternatives, or to exceed the scope of the intended change during implementation. Common failure modes:

- Rewriting an entire component when only a modifier was needed
- Modifying a base class definition when the solution was adding a new class alongside it
- Touching files or code outside the scope of the decision
- Not considering that there are multiple valid approaches before committing to one

This framework prevents those failures by requiring structured thinking before every edit and scope verification after.

---

## The Framework (7 Steps)

Every change — code, architecture, configuration, documentation — follows this sequence. Don't skip steps.

### 1. Identify Change
Define the change needed and its context: the actual problem, scope, goal, known limitations, and dependencies. Determine if additional information, visibility, or access is needed.

### 2. Intake Information
Gather all information determined by Step 1. If more is needed, acquire it if accessible or ask if not. Review existing architecture, conventions, and prior decisions for what applies. Don't stall for data that won't change the outcome, but don't proceed blindly when accessible information would.

### 3. Determine Criteria
Establish the objective decision-making basis and specific criteria within the context and scope from Steps 1 and 2. Criteria must be logically objective and validatable, not subjective. Include how to validate. Ground criteria in project needs, constraints, and goals — defensible to any reasonable observer.

### 4. Determine Possible Solutions
Identify ALL ways to achieve the outcome and satisfy the criteria. Be specific. Nothing should be arbitrary. Routes include:
- Rebuild the entire thing
- Rebuild parts of the thing
- Add a modifier/extension alongside the thing
- Change the context affecting the thing
- Combine approaches
- Other approaches not yet determined
- Defer — more information needed before acting

### 5. Rank and Decide
Given context, scope, and details from previous steps, which solution is the best fit and why? If multiple are close, would additional information objectively help elevate one to a clear winner? If so, gather it before committing.

### 6. Validate Decision
Does the chosen decision logically hold up? Does it contradict anything known? Is there a resource requirement that might cause reconsideration? Refer back to determinations from earlier steps.

### 7. Execute Precisely
Only touch what the chosen solution requires, nothing more, and only within the determined scope.

## Impact Tiers

Not every change requires the full 7-step framework. Assess impact before choosing the process tier:

### High Impact — Full 7-Step Framework
Applies when:
- Creating or modifying behavior
- Editing sensitive files (CSS frameworks, config files, CLAUDE.md, rules files, settings)
- Architecture changes
- Key logic changes
- Changes to things with many dependents

### Low Impact — Lighter 3-Step Check
Applies when:
- Adding or updating content
- Simple functions with limited dependents
- Documentation updates
- Reference changes

The lighter check:
1. **What am I changing?** + context and visibility
2. **What are the options?**
3. **Does it stay in scope?**
4. **Does this change affect parents, siblings, or dependents?**

---

## Post-Edit Scope Check (5 Questions)

After every edit, verify:

1. **Did this edit stay within the determined scope?**
2. **Was anything touched that was not part of the solution?**
3. **Were any existing definitions rewritten that should not have been?**
4. **Does the change match the decision that was made, or did scope creep during execution?**
5. **Check for secondary impact on parents, siblings, or dependents — if any requires review or action, flag to the user.**

If any answer is no, flag the issue before proceeding.

---

## Required Output Formats

The hooks require Claude to output specific formats. This ensures every step is visible and no steps are skipped. Each section shows the **format template** (with placeholders) followed by a **real example**.

> The examples below are from a real CSS framework project. Replace file names and scenarios with your own — the format and reasoning structure are what matter.

---

### High Impact — Pre-Edit

**Format (pass):**
```
High Impact — [description of change] ([reason classified as high impact])
Change — [what is being changed + relevant context]
Intake — [information gathered to inform the decision]
Criteria — [objective basis for evaluating solutions]
Solutions — (a) [best option], (b) [next option], (c) [other options]
Rank — [winner]; [reasoning why]
Validate — [does decision hold up? any contradictions with known patterns/rules?]
Execute — [precise scope of what will be touched, nothing more]
```

**Format (flag):**
```
High Impact — [description of change] ([reason classified as high impact])
Change — [what is being changed + relevant context]
Intake — [information gathered to inform the decision]
Criteria — [objective basis for evaluating solutions]
Solutions — (a) [option], (b) [option], (c) [option]
Rank — [chosen option]; [reasoning]
Validate — FLAG — [what contradicts, breaks, or can't be confirmed]
Execute — FLAG — [why execution can't proceed]
Proposed: [concrete alternative or action to resolve]
```
or:
```
Question: [specific clarification needed before proceeding]
```

**Example (pass):**
```
High Impact — modifying settings.local.json (sensitive)
Change — lighter check missing secondary impact step
Intake — current hook text has 3 steps, framework doc has 4
Criteria — concise, fits hook prompt, consistent with framework doc
Solutions — (a) append to existing text, (b) rewrite full lighter check, (c) add as separate sentence
Rank — (a) is clear winner; minimal change, stays consistent
Validate — appending doesn't break existing behavior, matches framework doc
Execute — one edit, append "→ does it affect parents/siblings/dependents?"
```

**Example (flag):**
```
High Impact — modifying df-input.css base .avatar class
Change — need transparent variant for image avatars
Intake — avatar uses bg-key + p-border-button, combo pattern uses separate modifiers
Criteria — must not break existing avatar usage, follow combo class pattern
Solutions — (a) rewrite base .avatar, (b) add .avatar.bordered modifier, (c) inline override
Rank — (a) rewrite base to remove bg-key default
Validate — FLAG — rewriting base breaks all existing avatar usage. Contradicts combo pattern.
Execute — FLAG — More information or alternatives needed.
Proposed: use (b) add .avatar.bordered and .avatar.basic as separate modifier rules, keeping base .avatar intact.
```

### High Impact — Post-Edit

**Format (pass):**
```
Scope Pass — [what was done + why it passes, including secondary status]
```

**Format (pass with secondary):**
```
Scope Pass — [what was done as planned]
Secondary: [what needs attention or review]
Proposed: [recommended action]
```

**Format (fail):**
```
Scope FAIL — [what failed, which check question, what was affected]
Proposed: [concrete next step to fix]
```

**Example (pass):**
```
Scope Pass — appended secondary impact step to lighter check text (no structural changes, takes effect next edit)
```

**Example (pass with secondary):**
```
Scope Pass — added layout-split rules to df-input.css as planned.
Secondary: docs pages still reference old main.sidebar pattern. ~30 files need migration.
Proposed: batch migrate docs pages as next step.
```

**Example (fail):**
```
Scope FAIL — rewrote base .avatar definition (question 3). Decision was to add modifiers only. All existing avatar usage affected.
Proposed: revert base .avatar, add .avatar.bordered and .avatar.basic as separate modifier rules in the combo class section.
```

---

### Low Impact — Pre-Edit

**Format (pass):**
```
Low Impact — [description of change] ([reason classified as low impact])
Change — [what is being changed + intake context + criteria. Does not affect X.]
Solutions — (a) [best option], (b) [other option]
Execute — [chosen option]; [scope check, secondary impact check, functional impact]
```

**Format (flag):**
```
Low Impact — [description of change] ([reason classified as low impact])
Change — [what is being changed + context that raises concern]
Solutions — (a) [option], (b) [option]
Execute — FLAG — [what needs verification or clarification before proceeding]
Question: [specific question to resolve before choosing a solution]
```

**Example (pass):**
```
Low Impact — adding alias note to buildguide stack table (additive with no dependents)
Change — document .stack as alias for .stack-col. No other related classes found. Does not affect existing classes.
Solutions — (a) modify existing row description, (b) add new row
Execute — (a); in scope, no secondary impact, no modification of class function.
```

**Example (flag):**
```
Low Impact — removing Custom/Other card from cs-builder preview section (content removal)
Change — remove card article element. Parent stack-col wrapper has 3 children, will have 2.
Solutions — (a) remove card only, (b) remove card and simplify parent if no longer needed
Execute — FLAG — need to verify parent wrapper is still needed with 2 children before deciding (a) vs (b).
Question: should the parent stack-col wrapper remain as-is, or be simplified now that it has fewer children?
```

---

### Low Impact — Post-Edit

**Format (pass):**
```
Scope Pass — [what was done + why it passes, including secondary status]
```

**Format (pass with secondary):**
```
Scope Pass — [what was done as planned]
Secondary: [what needs attention or review]
Proposed: [recommended action]
```

**Format (fail):**
```
Scope FAIL — [what failed, which check question, what was affected]
Proposed: [concrete next step to fix]
```

**Example (pass):**
```
Scope Pass — added alias note to one table row (no external effects)
```

**Example (pass with secondary):**
```
Scope Pass — removed Custom/Other card from preview section as decided.
Secondary: parent stack-col wrapper now has 2 children instead of 3. Wrapper still provides gap and content constraint.
Proposed: keep wrapper as-is — still serves its purpose.
```

**Example (fail):**
```
Scope FAIL — also modified the parent wrapper classes while removing the card (question 2). Decision was to remove card only.
Proposed: revert parent wrapper changes, keep only the card removal.
```

## Hook Implementation

These hooks enforce the framework automatically in Claude Code. They are pre-configured in the aria-knowledge plugin and fire without any manual setup.

- **PreToolUse** — fires before every Edit/Write, requires impact assessment and the appropriate decision process output
- **PostToolUse** — fires after every Edit/Write, requires scope verification in compact format

### How It Works

1. Developer or Claude initiates a file edit
2. **PreToolUse fires** → Claude outputs the required pre-edit format (impact assessment + framework steps) → proceeds with edit only if no FLAG
3. Edit is made
4. **PostToolUse fires** → Claude outputs the required post-edit format (pass/secondary/fail) → flags issues if any

The hooks are prompt-based — they inject context into Claude's reasoning at the right moments and require specific output formats to ensure no steps are skipped. They don't block or reject edits programmatically. The enforcement is through required visible output at each step.

---

## Reference-Based Builds (Rule 26)

The standard pre-edit check (Rule 22) relies on Edit's structural diff — `old_string`/`new_string` makes scope violations visible. When using Write to create a file based on an existing reference, there is no structural diff. The "comparison" between source and output happens entirely in the assessment, and the hooks check format compliance but can't verify assessment quality.

Reference-based builds require an explicit scope declaration before writing.

### Scope Declaration Format

```
**Source:** [file path]
**Changes:** [what will differ — classes, paths, specific modifications]
**Preserved:** [what stays verbatim — content, structure, icons, naming]
```

### When to Trigger

- Multi-step builds from a reference file
- Writing a large file (50+ lines) based on existing work
- "Copy," "version of," or "migrate" tasks
- NOT for small edits, new original files, or config changes

### How It Works

1. Before writing, present the scope declaration to the user
2. User confirms or adjusts the declaration
3. Write the file according to the declared scope
4. Post-write, verify against the declaration — any undeclared changes are scope failures

This is a conversation-level discipline, not a per-tool hook (too token-intensive for every Write). User confirmation is the quality gate that automated hooks can't provide for assessment quality.

## Customization

### Sensitive Files
Adjust the list of high-impact files to match your project. The default examples (df-input.css, df-preset.js, CLAUDE.md, working-rules.md, settings files) are project-specific. Replace with your equivalents — database schemas, API route definitions, CI configs, shared component libraries, etc.

### Impact Criteria
The high/low impact distinction can be tuned. Some teams may want a third tier (medium impact) or different triggers. The key principle: changes that affect behavior or have many dependents get more scrutiny than content updates.

### Additional Hook Points
You can extend this to other tool types:
- `Bash` matcher for destructive commands (git reset, rm, drop table)
- `Write` only (separate from Edit) for new file creation — see also "Reference-Based Builds" above for scope declarations on Write-from-reference tasks
- Custom matchers for project-specific tools
