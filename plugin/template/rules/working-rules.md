## How to Use This Document

These rules govern how you and Claude approach coding, architecture, and development decisions. They apply across all projects.

Rules are living — they get added, refined, or retired based on real experience (see Rule 2 and Rule 22). Rule numbers are permanent IDs — never renumber. Retired rules keep their number and get marked `[RETIRED]`.

## Coding Rules

### 1. Scope tasks tightly, but keep the whole system in view

Break work into focused, sequential steps for higher accuracy — but always consider how each piece fits into the holistic system. Don’t lose the integration picture while working on individual parts.

### 2. Let errors guide where you add context

Don’t preemptively document everything. Start lean, then add CLAUDE.md files or rules to correct specific, recurring mistakes. Context files earn their keep by fixing real problems.

### 3. Use reference implementations, but don’t assume they’re the best

Point to canonical examples to establish patterns, but don’t assume the existing approach is optimal. When alternatives exist, present the tradeoffs so we can determine the most objective and contextual solution together.

### 4. Prefer CLIs over MCP servers

Use CLIs to reduce token overhead, unless the MCP server provides functionality the CLI cannot.

### 5. Explain reasoning before making changes

For new patterns, walk through the approach for approval first. For implementation on existing patterns, prompt the user to approve batch changes rather than executing one by one.

### 6. Don’t delete or discard — archive and preserve

When refactoring or consolidating, move deprecated content to an archive with a pointer/map file so it’s findable but not pulled into every task’s context.

### 7. Flag uncertainty — don’t assume

When unsure about codebase behavior, business logic, or intent, say so and ask rather than guessing.

### 8. Start from needs, best practices, and context

Before jumping to solutions, understand the actual requirements, review what’s considered best practice, and factor in the specific project context.

### 9. Decisions must be logically or empirically justified

Intuitive guesses are welcome during ideation, but action should only be taken on decisions backed by clear, explicit reasoning.

### 10. Stay objective — either of us can be wrong

Evaluate ideas on their merits, not their source. Neither the user’s instinct nor Claude’s training should be treated as automatically correct.

### 11. Popularity is not validation

High star counts, trending status, or widespread adoption may indicate potential value but are not proof of quality or fit. Evaluate tools, libraries, and approaches on their actual merits in context.

### 12. Minimize dependencies — every addition has a cost

Before adding a library or tool, weigh its value against maintenance burden, security surface, and coupling. Prefer the existing stack when possible.

### 13. Simplest solution wins unless complexity creates clear advantage

Default to Occam’s razor — but validate it. Abstraction and complexity are justified only when they produce a clearly defined, measurable benefit.

### 14. Abstraction has diminishing returns

1–3 purposeful layers can be powerful (e.g., `color-primary` → `text-primary`). Beyond that, each layer increases risk of bugs, security issues, and cognitive overhead. Every layer needs clear justification.

### 15. Test at boundaries and edge cases, not just happy paths

Happy paths represent ideal behavior but won’t happen all the time. Focus testing on API boundaries, user input, service contracts, error states, and permission edges.

### 16. Use semantic, self-evident naming

Names should communicate purpose clearly to someone without assumed context. Prefer names that describe what something does or represents over jargon or implementation knowledge (e.g., `useRequireAuth` over `useAuthGuard`).

### 17. Fail gracefully — always handle the unhappy path

Every external call, user input, and state transition should have explicit error handling. Silent failures are worse than loud ones.

### 18. Prefer foundational design over patching

Ask whether better upfront design would eliminate a problem rather than bolting on fixes. Hard-coded solutions often lack flexibility, requiring add-ons. A single purposeful abstraction layer adds resilience, but too many create new problems. Find the right foundational level that minimizes future patching without over-engineering.

## Process Rules

### 19. When something fails, learn from it

Understand why it failed and capture that learning as context for future improvement. Failures are data, not just problems.

### 20. Always validate before assuming completion

After executing a step, perform at least one verification pass before moving on. Don’t assume it worked — confirm it.

### 21. Document decisions, not just implementations

Capture the why — what was considered, what was ruled out, and the reasoning. This creates an auditable trail of decision-making that can be referenced to learn and improve over time.

### 22. Follow the change decision framework

Every change — code, architecture, configuration, documentation — follows this sequence. Don’t skip steps. See `knowledge/rules/change-decision-framework.md` for the detailed version with examples, impact tiers, and hook implementation.

1. **Identify Change** — Define the change needed and its context: the actual problem, scope, goal, known limitations, and dependencies. Determine if additional information, visibility, or access is needed.

2. **Intake Information** — Gather all information determined by Step 1. If more is needed, acquire it if accessible or ask if not. Review existing architecture, taxonomy, conventions, and prior decisions for what applies. Don’t stall for data that won’t change the outcome, but don’t proceed blindly when accessible information would.

3. **Determine Criteria** — Establish the objective decision-making basis and specific criteria within the context and scope from Steps 1 and 2. Criteria must be logically objective and validatable, not subjective. Include how to validate. Ground criteria in project needs, constraints, and goals — defensible to any reasonable observer.

4. **Determine Possible Solutions** — Identify ALL ways to achieve the outcome and satisfy the criteria. Be specific. Nothing should be arbitrary. Routes include: rebuild the entire thing, rebuild parts of it, add a modifier/extension alongside it, change the context affecting it, combine approaches, other approaches not yet determined, or defer if more information is needed.

5. **Rank and Decide** — Given context, scope, and details from previous steps, which solution is the best fit and why? If multiple are close, would additional information objectively help elevate one to a clear winner? If so, gather it before committing.

6. **Validate Decision** — Does the chosen decision logically hold up? Does it contradict anything known? Is there a resource requirement that might cause reconsideration? Refer back to determinations from earlier steps.

7. **Execute Precisely** — Only touch what the chosen solution requires, nothing more, and only within the determined scope.

## Meta Rules

### 23. Review learnings before saving

Always review learnings and proposed rules with the user for validation before saving them. Don’t auto-add rules — discuss first, save only after approval.

### 24. Process steps define "done," not task outputs

When a workflow generates a dynamic list of items (audit findings, review comments, bug fixes), completing that list is not completing the process. The workflow’s own steps — setup, execution, teardown, logging — exist independent of what was found. Always return to the process definition to verify all steps are complete, not just the generated work.

### 25. Check secondary impact on every change

After every edit, check if the change affects parents, siblings, or dependents. Removing a child element may make its parent wrapper unnecessary. Adding a class may conflict with inherited properties. Adding a dependency may affect build size or load order. This check should happen automatically after every code change, not only when prompted.

**Origin:** Removing a child element without checking whether the parent wrapper was still needed. Now also enforced via PostToolUse hook (question 5 in the scope check).

### 26. Declare scope before building from references

When creating or rebuilding a file based on an existing reference, declare what will change and what will be preserved before writing. The reference defines content scope — undeclared changes are out of scope. Present the declaration for user confirmation on multi-step or large builds. See `knowledge/rules/change-decision-framework.md` for the full scope declaration format.

**Origin:** A file migration where Rule 22 hooks passed (format-compliant) but undeclared content changes slipped through.
