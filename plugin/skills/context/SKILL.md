# /context — On-Demand Knowledge Retrieval

Query the knowledge tag index and load relevant promoted files into the conversation context.

## Step 0: Resolve Config

Read `~/.claude/aria-knowledge.local.md` and extract:
- `knowledge_folder` — required
- `projects_enabled` — default `false`
- `projects_list` — default empty (only relevant if `projects_enabled: true`)

Parse `projects_list` into a tag→path map. The format is comma-separated `tag:path` pairs (e.g., `cs-builder:cs/cs-space-builder,df:df`). Tags are used to identify project-specific files; paths are not used by `/context` (they're for CWD detection in other skills).

If the config file doesn't exist, stop: "aria-knowledge is not configured. Run /setup to get started."

## Step 1: Read Index

Read `{knowledge_folder}/index.md`.

If the file doesn't exist, stop: "No knowledge index found. Run `/index` to build it."

Parse the index to extract:
- `## Projects` section — project name/key and their relevant tags
- `## Known Tags` section — the canonical tag list
- `## Tag Index` section — tag → file mappings for known tags
- `## Other Tags` section — tag → file mappings for freeform tags

## Step 2: Parse Query

The user's argument is a space-separated list of tags with optional `AND` keyword.

**Parsing rules:**
- Split on spaces
- If the token `AND` (case-insensitive) appears, use **intersection mode** — a file must have ALL specified tags
- Otherwise, use **union mode** (default) — a file matches if it has ANY of the specified tags
- Remove `AND` tokens from the tag list

Examples:
- `/context stripe` → tags: [`stripe`], mode: OR
- `/context api pagination` → tags: [`api`, `pagination`], mode: OR
- `/context api AND pagination` → tags: [`api`, `pagination`], mode: AND
- `/context ss` → tags: [`ss`], mode: OR (with project expansion)

If no argument provided, stop: "Usage: `/context <tag1> [tag2] [AND tag3]`. Run `/index` to see available tags."

## Step 3: Project Tag Expansion

For each tag in the query, check if it matches a project key in the `## Projects` section (e.g., `ss`, `cs`, `df`, `aria`).

If a tag matches a project:
1. Keep the project tag itself in the search
2. Also add all of that project's "Relevant tags" to the search
3. Notify the user:
   ```
   Expanded `ss` to include: api, django, nextjs, stripe, supabase, database, deployment
   ```

Project expansion only applies in union (OR) mode. In AND mode, project tags are treated as literal tags (a file must be tagged `ss` specifically).

## Step 4: Match Files

File discovery has two sources: the index (cross-project tagged files) and the filesystem (project-specific files under `projects/{tag}/**`). Both contribute to the result set; results are categorized so Step 5 can present them grouped.

### Step 4a: Index-driven matches (cross-project)

Scan the `## Tag Index` and `## Other Tags` sections for entries matching the query tags.

**Exclude files whose path starts with `projects/`** — those are project-tier files, handled by Step 4b. This prevents duplicate listings when a project-tier file is discoverable via both its YAML tag (in the index) and its path (via Glob in Step 4b). Since `/index` (Phase 4+) scans project-tier files and adds them to the Tag Index with path-derived tags, a project file tagged `agentic-ui` would otherwise appear in both Step 4a (via the `agentic-ui` tag match) and Step 4b (via the `projects/{tag}/**` Glob) — the exclusion puts project-tier files under Step 4b's authoritative categorization.

**Union mode (OR):** Collect non-`projects/` files that appear under any of the query tags. Deduplicate — each file appears once even if it matches multiple tags.

**Intersection mode (AND):** Collect non-`projects/` files that appear under ALL of the query tags. A file must be listed under every specified tag.

For each matching file, collect:
- File path (relative to knowledge folder)
- Description (from the index entry)
- All tags the file carries (scan all tag sections for this file path)
- Category: `cross-project`

### Step 4b: Filesystem-driven matches (project tier)

Skip this sub-step entirely if `projects_enabled: false` or `projects_list` is empty.

For each query tag that matches a configured project tag (i.e., is a key in the parsed `projects_list` from Step 0):
1. Glob `{knowledge_folder}/projects/{tag}/**/*.md` to find all project-specific files.
2. Exclude `projects/{tag}/README.md` from the results (it's per-project navigation, not knowledge content).
3. For each file found:
   - Read the YAML frontmatter to extract `tags:` (if present) and the file's first H1 or summary line as description (if `tags:` is missing, treat the file as carrying just the project tag).
   - In **intersection mode (AND)**: only include the file if its tag set contains ALL query tags (the project tag is implicit since the file lives under `projects/{tag}/`).
   - In **union mode (OR)**: include all files found by the Glob (matching the project tag is sufficient).
4. Mark each result with category: `project-specific` and the originating project tag.

**Empty folder handling (Decision #8):** If the Glob returns no files for a configured project tag, record a "no project-specific files yet in `projects/{tag}/`" note. Don't treat this as an error — Step 5 will mention it informationally and continue with cross-project results.

**Deduplication:** Cross-source duplication is prevented by Step 4a's `projects/**` path exclusion — project-tier files are always routed through Step 4b, never through the index-driven Step 4a. Within each sub-step, deduplicate by path as before (a file matching multiple tags in Step 4a, or a file found multiple times within Step 4b's Glob, appears only once).

## Step 5: Present Summary

If matches found, group results by category — **Project-specific first, Cross-project second**. Use a single continuous numbering across both groups so the user can select by number across categories.

```
Found N files matching: [tags] ([OR|AND])

## Project-specific (M files)
1. projects/cs-builder/decisions/004-state-sync.md — State sync between AI and wizard [cs-builder, state-management]
2. projects/cs-builder/patterns/internal-patterns.md — Reusable patterns within cs-builder [cs-builder, patterns]

## Cross-project (K files)
3. approaches/api-pagination.md — Cursor-based pagination patterns [api, pagination, stripe]
4. decisions/003-cursor-vs-offset.md — Why we chose cursor pagination [api, stripe]
5. references/stripe-webhook-patterns.md — Webhook signature verification [stripe, webhooks]

Load which files? (all / numbers / none)
```

**Section omission:** if a section has zero results, omit its heading entirely. If only project-specific results exist, show only the "Project-specific" section. If only cross-project results exist, show only the "Cross-project" section (and you can omit the heading since the categorization is moot — match the original flat presentation in that case).

**Empty project-folder note (Decision #8):** if Step 4b recorded a "no project-specific files yet" note for any configured project tag in the query, append a single line after the result list (before the prompt):

```
(No files yet in projects/cs-builder/ — folder is configured but empty.)
```

Do NOT pad results with empty folder notes for project tags that weren't queried.

Show the file's tags in brackets after the description so the user can see why each file matched.

**If no matches at all:**

```
No files match tag(s): [tags]

Known tags: api, architecture, css, database, ...
Run `/index` to rebuild if you've recently added files.
```

If the query included a project tag and that project's folder was empty, mention it here too:

```
No files match tag(s): [cs-builder]

(projects/cs-builder/ exists but is empty — populate it via /extract or by creating files manually.)
Known tags: api, architecture, ...
```

## Step 6: Load Selected Files

Based on user response:
- **"all"** — read and present the full content of every matched file
- **Numbers (e.g., "1 3" or "1,3")** — read and present only the specified files
- **"none"** — stop, don't load anything

For each selected file:
1. Read `{knowledge_folder}/{file_path}`
2. Present the full file content

After loading, confirm: "Loaded N knowledge files into context."

## Rules

- **Read-only** — this skill never modifies any files
- **Discovery sources:** the index for cross-project files (no file reads at this stage); the filesystem (Glob) for project-tier files under `projects/{tag}/**` when project tags are queried. File contents are only read at load time (Step 6) — except for project-tier files where YAML frontmatter is parsed during discovery to extract tags and descriptions.
- **Promoted files only** — does not search backlogs, intake, rules, or logs
- **No full-text search** — tag-based matching only. If the user needs content search, suggest using Grep directly
- **Present before loading** — always show the summary and let the user choose which files to load
