# /setup — Knowledge Tools Configuration

Walk the user through configuring their knowledge folder and plugin settings. Safe to re-run at any time — only touches what needs updating.

## Step 1: Check for Existing Config

Read `~/.claude/aria-knowledge.local.md`.

- **If it exists:** show current settings and say "aria-knowledge is already configured. I'll check for updates." Then proceed to Step 2 in **update mode** — scan for missing structure, re-diff templated files, check dependencies.
- **If it doesn't exist:** say "Let's set up aria-knowledge. This will configure your knowledge folder and preferences." Proceed to Step 2 in **fresh mode**.

## Step 2: Knowledge Folder Location

Ask the user:
> "Where would you like your knowledge folder? You can:
> (a) Provide a path to an existing folder
> (b) Create a new one — I'll ask where to put it"

If **(a) existing path:**
- Verify the path exists and is a directory
- Proceed to Step 3 in **existing mode**

If **(b) create new:**
- Ask for the desired location (parent directory + folder name)
- Create the directory
- Proceed to Step 3 in **create mode**

## Step 3: Folder Structure Validation

Read the expected structure from `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/template/`.

**Expected directories:** `intake/`, `intake/notes/`, `intake/attachments/`, `intake/clippings/`, `intake/pre-compact-captures/`, `logs/`, `rules/`, `approaches/`, `decisions/`, `guides/`, `references/`, `archive/`

**Expected files:** `README.md`, `OVERVIEW.md`, `LOCAL.md`, `intake/insights-backlog.md`, `intake/decisions-backlog.md`, `intake/extraction-backlog.md`, `intake/ideas-backlog.md`, `logs/knowledge-audit-log.md`, `logs/config-audit-log.md`, `rules/working-rules.md`, `rules/user-rules.md`, `rules/change-decision-framework.md`, `rules/enforcement-mechanisms.md`, `guides/README.md`, `approaches/README.md`, `decisions/README.md`, `references/README.md`, `archive/README.md`

**User-owned files (created once from template, never overwritten or diffed):** `LOCAL.md` (project-specific guide), `rules/user-rules.md` (your custom rules — ARIA never touches this file), `guides/README.md`, `approaches/README.md`, `decisions/README.md`, `references/README.md`, `archive/README.md` (directory stubs users may customize).

**In create mode:** Create all directories and copy all template files.

**In existing mode:** Scan what's present vs missing.
- For missing **directories**: create them silently.
- For missing **files**: copy from template and note what was added.
- For existing **files**: do NOT overwrite — collect for diffing in Step 4.
- Report: "Created N directories, added N files, found N existing files to check."

**Project tier scaffolding** (if `projects_enabled: true` in current or pending config) is deferred to **Step 7c** — it runs after the config is written so it uses the final values (including answers from Step 6 that aren't in the config file yet during Step 3).

## Step 4: File Diffing

For each templated file that already exists in the user's folder, compare against the plugin's shipped version in `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/template/`.

**Files to diff:** `rules/working-rules.md`, `rules/change-decision-framework.md`, `rules/enforcement-mechanisms.md`, `README.md`, `OVERVIEW.md`, `projects/README.md` (plugin-managed if present)

**Never diff:** `LOCAL.md` (user-owned), `rules/user-rules.md` (user-owned — your custom rules), directory README stubs (`guides/README.md`, `approaches/README.md`, `decisions/README.md`, `references/README.md`, `archive/README.md`), backlog files (`intake/insights-backlog.md`, `intake/decisions-backlog.md`, `intake/extraction-backlog.md`, `intake/ideas-backlog.md`), audit log files (`logs/knowledge-audit-log.md`, `logs/config-audit-log.md`), and per-project READMEs (`projects/{tag}/README.md` and any other content under `projects/{tag}/**`) — these contain user data or user-customizable content.

For each file with differences:
1. Notify: "[filename] differs from the plugin version."
2. Show a brief summary of what's different (not the full diff unless asked).
3. Offer options:
   - **Keep mine** — no change
   - **Use plugin version** — overwrite with template
   - **Show diff** — display the full diff, then ask again

If no files differ (or all are new), skip this step silently.

In **update mode** (re-run): always diff, even if the file was previously kept. The plugin version may have changed.

## Step 5: Dependency Check

Check if the `explanatory-output-style` plugin is installed:

```bash
find ~/.claude/plugins -name "explanatory-output-style" -type d 2>/dev/null | head -1
```

- **If found:** "explanatory-output-style plugin detected. Insight capture will be enabled."
- **If not found:** "The explanatory-output-style plugin generates Insight blocks that aria-knowledge can capture automatically. It's an official Anthropic plugin. Want to install it? (recommended, but optional)"
  - If user says yes: guide them to install it (the exact install mechanism depends on their Claude Code setup)
  - If user says no: "Insight capture will be disabled. You can enable it later by installing the plugin and re-running /setup."

Record the result as `true` or `false`.

## Step 6: Cadence Configuration

Present current or default cadences:
> "Audit cadences control how often you're prompted to review knowledge:
> - **Knowledge audit:** every 3 days (scans memory/plans for extractable knowledge)
> - **Config audit:** every 14 days (checks configs and docs for drift)
> - **Update check:** every 30 days (prompts to run /setup for plugin template updates)
>
> Want to change any cadence? (Enter new values or press enter to keep defaults)"

Record the values.

### Advanced Options

If the user asks about advanced options or re-runs setup with existing config, also offer:

> "Advanced settings (defaults are fine for most users):
> - **Freeform tag promotion threshold:** 3 (suggest promoting a freeform tag to known after it appears on this many files)
> - **Staleness threshold:** 6 months (flag knowledge files not updated within this period)
> - **Ideas staleness threshold:** 21 days (during `/audit-knowledge`, mark ideas-backlog entries older than this with `[STALE — still relevant?]` to prompt Accept/Reject/Defer decisions)
> - **Auto-capture on compaction:** true (save transcript snapshot before context compaction)
> - **Critical paths:** (empty) comma-separated path patterns that always require HIGH impact assessment (e.g., auth/*,payments/*,migrations/*)
> - **Project-specific knowledge tier:** disabled (creates `projects/{tag}/` subdirectories for project-specific decisions and patterns; opt in if you want to organize knowledge by project alongside the cross-project tree. If enabled, you'll be asked an inline follow-up about auto-loading project context on session start.)
>
> Want to change any? (Enter new values or press enter to keep defaults)"

Record the values. If the user doesn't ask about advanced options during initial setup, use the defaults silently.

### Project Setup (only if user enables the project-specific knowledge tier)

If the user enables (or keeps enabled) the project-specific knowledge tier in Advanced Options, ask four follow-up questions. In **update mode** where values already exist in the config, show the current value for each question and let the user keep it (press enter) or enter a new value — this is the discoverable path for toggling `auto_load_project_context` on a re-run when the tier was previously enabled:

1. **Project list** — "Comma-separated `tag:relative-path` pairs (e.g., `cs-builder:cs/cs-space-builder,df:df,ss:ss`). Paths are relative to the parent of your knowledge folder (typically `~/Projects/`). Press enter to defer adding projects:"
2. **Project remotes (optional)** — "Optional git-remote URL patterns for fallback project detection when CWD doesn't match a configured path. Comma-separated `tag:url-substring` pairs (e.g., `cs-builder:craftxlogic/cs-space-builder`). Press enter to skip:"
3. **Promotion threshold** — "Minimum number of projects that must share a similar pattern before `/audit-knowledge` suggests cross-project promotion (default 2):"
4. **Auto-load project context on session start** — "When your CWD matches a configured project, should SessionStart automatically suggest `/context {tag}`? This is a runtime convenience — the project tier works fine without it, and you can change this later by editing `auto_load_project_context` in `~/.claude/aria-knowledge.local.md`. (y/n, default n):"

**Validate input:**
- Project tags cannot contain `:` or `,` (these are the parser delimiters). If invalid, show the offending tag and re-prompt.
- Promotion threshold must be a plain integer ≥ 1. If invalid, re-prompt.
- Auto-load answer must be `y`/`n` (or empty for default). If invalid, re-prompt.
- For each `tag:path` pair, warn (don't error) if the resolved path doesn't exist on disk yet — the user may be configuring projects they haven't created.

**Existing-folder detection:**

Before prompting, scan the user's knowledge folder for an existing `projects/` subdirectory:

- **If found AND `projects_enabled` is unset in config:** Skip the Advanced Options bullet for this feature; instead prompt directly: "Detected existing `projects/` folder with these subdirectories: [list]. Enable project-specific knowledge tier? (y/n)" — if yes, auto-populate `projects_list` from detected subdirectories (prompt for the path mapping per detected tag), then ask question 4 from the Project Setup flow above so the user can opt into `auto_load_project_context` at the same time.
- **If found AND `projects_enabled: false` explicitly in config:** Leave the existing folder untouched; note in verbose output: "An existing `projects/` folder was detected but the projects tier is disabled in config. Folder is preserved; automation is off."
- **If found AND `projects_enabled: true`:** Verify each detected subdirectory is in `projects_list`; prompt to add any missing ones. Then surface the current `auto_load_project_context` value as a status check: "Auto-load project context on session start is currently [on/off]. Change? (y/n, default n — keep current)." — this is the re-run discoverability path for toggling the flag when the tier was previously enabled.

**Never auto-delete or auto-rewrite existing `projects/` content.**

## Step 7: Write Config

Write `~/.claude/aria-knowledge.local.md` with the collected settings:

```yaml
---
knowledge_folder: [path from Step 2]
audit_cadence_knowledge: [value from Step 6]
audit_cadence_config: [value from Step 6]
explanatory_plugin: [true/false from Step 5]
audit_cadence_update: [value from Step 6, default 30]
freeform_promotion_threshold: [value from Step 6, default 3]
staleness_threshold_months: [value from Step 6, default 6]
ideas_staleness_threshold_days: [value from Step 6, default 21]
auto_capture: [true/false from Step 6, default true]
critical_paths: [comma-separated patterns from Step 6, default empty]
projects_enabled: [true/false from Step 6, default false]
projects_list: [comma-separated tag:path pairs from Step 6, default empty]
projects_remotes: [comma-separated tag:url-pattern pairs from Step 6, default empty]
projects_promotion_threshold: [integer from Step 6, default 2]
auto_load_project_context: [true/false from Step 6, default false]
---
```

Add a markdown body below the frontmatter:

```markdown
# Knowledge Tools Configuration

Configured by /setup on [today's date].
```

In **update mode:** preserve any user-added content in the markdown body below the frontmatter when rewriting.

**Formatting rules** — the config file MUST follow these exact conventions or the hook scripts cannot parse it. The hooks parse this file using pure `grep + sed` (no jq/yq/python) — these constraints exist so the substitution patterns in `bin/config.sh` work correctly, and any deviation breaks parsing silently.
- Frontmatter delimiters must be exactly `---` on their own line (no leading spaces, no trailing content)
- Each key must start at column 1 with no indentation
- Keys use the exact names shown above (no quoting, no trailing spaces)
- Values must NOT be quoted — write `knowledge_folder: /path/to/folder`, not `knowledge_folder: "/path/to/folder"`
- **Empty values:** write `key:` with nothing after the colon (optionally one trailing space). Do NOT write `key: null`, `key: ""`, `key: none`, or `key: []` — the parser treats those as literal string values (`"null"`, `"\"\""`, etc.) and validators won't normalize them to empty
- `knowledge_folder` must be an absolute path (starts with `/`) and must not contain `..`
- Cadence values must be plain integers (no units, no quotes)
- `projects_enabled` must be exactly `true` or `false` (not `True`, `yes`, `1`, etc.)
- `projects_list` and `projects_remotes`: comma-separated `tag:value` pairs, no spaces around the colon or comma (e.g., `cs-builder:cs/cs-space-builder,df:df`)
- Project tags cannot contain colons or commas (the parser splits on these)
- `projects_promotion_threshold` must be a plain integer ≥ 1 (no units, no quotes)
- `auto_load_project_context` must be exactly `true` or `false` (not `True`, `yes`, `1`, etc.)
- No blank lines between frontmatter entries

## Step 7b: Verify Config Round-Trip

After writing the config file, read it back and verify that each value can be extracted using the same patterns that `config.sh` uses. This catches formatting issues before the user discovers them in the next session.

**Verification checks:**
1. Read `~/.claude/aria-knowledge.local.md`
2. Extract the frontmatter block (content between the first and second `---` lines)
3. For each key, verify the value matches what was intended:
   - `knowledge_folder` — grep for `^knowledge_folder:` and confirm the extracted path matches Step 2's value
   - `audit_cadence_knowledge` — confirm it's the integer from Step 6
   - `audit_cadence_config` — confirm it's the integer from Step 6
   - `explanatory_plugin` — confirm it's `true` or `false`
   - `audit_cadence_update` — confirm it's the integer from Step 6
   - `freeform_promotion_threshold` — confirm it's the integer from Step 6
   - `staleness_threshold_months` — confirm it's the integer from Step 6
   - `ideas_staleness_threshold_days` — confirm it's the integer from Step 6
   - `auto_capture` — confirm it's `true` or `false`
   - `critical_paths` — confirm it's a comma-separated string of path patterns (or empty)
   - `projects_enabled` — confirm it's `true` or `false`
   - `projects_list` — confirm it's a comma-separated string of `tag:path` pairs (or empty); validate no project tag contains `:` or `,`
   - `projects_remotes` — confirm it's a comma-separated string of `tag:url-pattern` pairs (or empty); validate no project tag contains `:` or `,`
   - `projects_promotion_threshold` — confirm it's a plain integer ≥ 1 (matches Step 6 input)
   - `auto_load_project_context` — confirm it's `true` or `false`
   - **Empty-sentinel check** — for string-valued keys with an empty default (`critical_paths`, `projects_list`, `projects_remotes`): confirm the raw extracted value is not the literal string `null`, `""`, `none`, or `[]`. If the key is intended to be empty, the value after the colon must be truly empty (nothing or a single trailing space). Rewrite the key as `key:` and re-verify.

**If any check fails:** rewrite the file with corrected formatting and verify again. Report which value failed and what was fixed.

**If all checks pass:** proceed to Step 7c silently.

## Step 7c: Project Tier Scaffolding

Runs only if the config just written has `projects_enabled: true` and a non-empty `projects_list`. Skip entirely otherwise — no action, no output.

Scaffold the project tier using the final config values:

1. **Create `projects/` directory** if it doesn't exist.
2. **Copy `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/template/projects/README.md` to `projects/README.md`** if missing (plugin-managed; will be diffed on future `/setup` runs).
3. **For each entry in `projects_list` (parsed as `tag:path` pairs):**
   - Create `projects/{tag}/` if missing.
   - Create `projects/{tag}/decisions/` and `projects/{tag}/patterns/` if missing.
   - If `projects/{tag}/README.md` does not exist, generate it from this per-project template:
     ```markdown
     ---
     Last updated: [today's date]
     tags: [{tag}, knowledge-structure]
     ---

     # {Project Display Name} Project Knowledge

     Project-specific architecture decisions, patterns, and gotchas for {project display name}.

     ## Structure

     - `decisions/` — Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) — numbered sequentially per project (001, 002, ...)
     - `patterns/` — Reusable patterns specific to this project
     - `guides/` (optional) — Operational knowledge specific to this project; create on demand
     - `references/` (optional) — External resources specific to this project; create on demand

     ## Promotion

     When a pattern in this folder is validated in another project, `/audit-knowledge` will surface it as a candidate to promote to `knowledge/approaches/`. See `knowledge/projects/README.md` for the full promotion ladder.

     ## Related
     - [../README.md](../README.md) — projects/ tier overview
     - [../../index.md](../../index.md) — tag index
     ```
     - **Project Display Name** is derived from the tag with hyphens converted to spaces and title-cased (e.g., `cs-builder` → `Cs Builder`). If the tag doesn't produce a sensible display name, use the tag as-is and prompt the user to edit the README header.
4. **Never overwrite** existing per-project READMEs or content under `projects/{tag}/` — these are user-owned.
5. **Report** what was scaffolded: "Project tier: created N directories, N per-project READMEs."

## Step 8: Confirm

Output a summary:

```
Setup complete!
- Knowledge folder: [path]
- Knowledge audit: every [N] days
- Config audit: every [N] days
- Update check: every [N] days
- Insight capture: [enabled/disabled]
- Auto-capture on compaction: [enabled/disabled]
- Files added: [N]
- Files updated: [N]
- Files kept (user version): [N]

Two habits that make ARIA most effective:
- Run /extract before ending sessions — captures knowledge while the full conversation is in context
- Respond to "Knowledge audit due" prompts — promotes pending items so /context can surface them later
Everything else runs automatically via hooks.
```
